    <span>What Is Diamond Painting?</span>
    <p>
      Diamond painting is a simple and addictive hobby that has taken the
      crafting world by storm. Creating a sparkling masterpiece is as easy as
      affixing vibrantly colored resin rhinestones to a self-adhesive canvas
      with a diamond art kit. The canvas is printed with the design as well as
      symbols to let you know exactly which color to place in each spot.
      <br />
      A relatively new art form to the craft industry, diamond art has rapidly
      become a favorite among beginner and experienced hobbyists alike. It does
      not require any special skills, and anyone can make beautiful diamond
      artworks that shimmer, sparkle and shine when they paint with diamonds.
